cloud-file-system
=================

Simple REST interface to Amazon S3 with Angular.js front-end.

To get started update src/main/resources/FileSystem.properties to contain your S3 keys and bucket name.

Then run "mvn package" and copy cloud-files.war from the target directory into a java webapp container like Tomcat.
